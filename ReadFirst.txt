Hello, Thanks for Downloading


A few things you need to know

-This will only work through pygame
-There are differences in different controllers
-This is used as a demonstration simply for the buttons, the analog stick motion wont work but if requested I can make a fully functional one in the future.

If you do not have pygame installed on your pc, simply go to your Terminal and enter "pip install pygame"

I used an xbox one controller when making this, therefore the print action is configured for the xbox controller. If you would like to learn how to use a different platform controller you can find the inputs here:

and finally if you have any questions, let me know
